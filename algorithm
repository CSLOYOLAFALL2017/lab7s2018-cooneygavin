#Functions's purpose: read in a file name from the user and return it once they give one that exists
#Parameters: None
#Return: file name
<<<<<<< HEAD

1.) Import os
2.) create functions
3.) read file

import os
def fileName():
    fileInput=input("What file would you like to read?)
    while not os.path.exists(fileInput)
        fileInput=input("What file would you like to read?")
    return file_input








=======
1) Import os
2) Ask user for file name
3) Loop until the user enters a valid file name
4) Return file name
>>>>>>> origin/master


#Function's purpose: Process the file
#Parameters: file name of file to read from
#Return: The maximum profit
<<<<<<< HEAD

1.) separate information
2.) print movie with greatest revenue

def profit(fileInput):
    profit_file=open(fileInput, "r")
    profitMade = 0
    for line in profit_file:
        date, title, budget, gross = profit_file.split(",")
        gross - budget = movieProfit
        if movieProfit > profitMade:
            profitMade = line
    print(profitMade)



=======
1) Open movies.csv file
2) Read lines in file
3) Split lines into date, title, budget, and gross and read line by line in file suing line.split(",")
4) Loop to find the maximum profit (gross-budget)
5) Convert budget and gross into floats
6) Return maximum profit
>>>>>>> origin/master


#Function's purpose: Process the file
#Parameters: file name of file to read from, file name of file to write to
#Return: None
<<<<<<< HEAD

1.) create function to open new file to write and read previous file
2.) write information from original file being read to the new file
=======
1) Open movies.csv file to read
2) Ask user to name the new file
3) Open new file to write in
4) Loop to process old lines in file
5) Write the information from the old file into the new file (line by line)
5) Close the new file
>>>>>>> origin/master


#Function's purpose: main
#Parameters: None
#Return: None
<<<<<<< HEAD









=======
1) Create main function
2) Put all the other functions into the main function
3) Output the file name, the highest movie profit, and tell user their new file has been saved
4) Call main function
>>>>>>> origin/master
